### This is a CLI booking application built using Golang

- Slice is an Abstraction of an Array
- Slices are more flexible and powerful: variable-length or get a sub-array of its own
- Slices are also index-based and have a size, but is Resized when needed

### LOOPS
*	In general, **languages provide various control structures** to control the application flow
*	A loop statement allows us to **execute code multiple times** in a loop.
*	there is only **one** loop in Golang, it doesn't have: 'while-loop' 'do-while-loop' or 'for-each-loop'

### Infinite Loop

### For Loop "strings.Fields()"
*	Splits the string with white space as seperator
*	And returns a slice with the split elements
*	"Nicole Smith" string	["Nicole","Smith"]

### Blank Identifier
*	underscore _ is used to ignore a variable you don't want to use
*	In Go you need to make unused variables explicit

### If Conditional True or False
*	the default condition is set to 'true'
*	there is only one If and one Else statement
*	there can be multiple else-if statements.

### Logical Operator !
*	the exclamation mark ! is called Logical **NOT** operator
*	! reverses the boolean value
*	if a condition is true, the ! now makes the condition false

### Switch Statement
*	Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values
*	'default' statement handles the case, if no match is found

### Functions
*	**Encapsulate code** into own container (=func). Which *logically belong together*
*	Like variable name, the function needs to have a **descriptive name**
*	**Call the func by its name** whenever the block of code needs to be executed

### Functions: more Use cases
*	Group logic that belongs together
*	Reuse logic and so reducing duplication of code
