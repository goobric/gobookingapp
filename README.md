*	A loo statement allows us to **execute code multiple times** in a loop.
*	there is only **one** loop in Golang, it doesn't have: 'while-loop' 'do-while-loop' or 'for-each-loop'

### Infinite Loop


### For Loop "strings.Fields()"
*	Splits the string with white space as seperator
*	And returns a slice with the split elements
*	"Nicole Smith" string	["Nicole","Smith"]
